# Obey the testing goat

## 1. The repo
I'm about to start a new job as a software testing engineer so I wanted to get a head start by reviewing [Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/part1.harry.html) and I wanted to keep track of every exercise the book has for its readers in this repo, so... **here it is!**

## 2. Structure
I will be updating the this section with the project structure a little bit more down the line when I get a full grasp of it.

## 3. Installation and running steps
Also I will be updating this section with install and running steps for anyone who wants to try it.
